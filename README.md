# DST-Unburnable Beefalo

For Don't Starve Together

## Disclaimer

I created this mod back in 2016. It still works, although it definitely needs updating to be kept with Don't Starve Together's latest modding standards. That said, using it won't break anything in your game.

## Description

This mod stops Beefalos from catching fire. Especially useful to stop smoldering beefalos in the summer.

Note: This is a work in progress. I'll probably end up combining it with my Beefalo Horns Without Harm mod.
